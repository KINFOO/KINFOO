## Hi

I'll give you a secret: I like to _delivrer stable quality_.

### Deliver

To deliver product I obviously rely on _Continuous Integration_, mainly using
_GitHub Actions_ and _Docker_

### Stable

I like to _deliver fast_. Still, I do not like to _break things_. So we can
talk about _code coverage_ and _regression test_.

### Quality

There are several areas to cover to acheive software quality.

I use several kind of tests, also usability, performance and maintainability.
